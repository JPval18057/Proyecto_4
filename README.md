# Parking lot simulator
The main objective of this project was to build a parking lot simulator using infrared sensors or pushbuttons, a ESP32 microcontroller, an ARM Cortex M4 TivaC board and a variety of electronic components like LEDs, resistors, and capacitors.

The TivaC board managed all the sensor readings, processed the data and sent it to the ESP32. This one took the data, formated it and updated the self hosted webpage that displayed the number of available parking spaces. This project includes a wide range of programming languages, from C code to Javascript and CSS. It also adressed different 32 bit microcontroller architectures to coordinate the communication of both boards.
